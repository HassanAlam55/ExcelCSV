Notes of things to do
have variable beta and alph
beta and alpha derived from real data.
need to use non_extneded columns
    do hybrid skip  ahead in no crash.
    other steps in data prep that we skipped. 
    the labels code has  lower case date change that.
    time variant alpha beta - initially just use constant alpha and beta. redo with compute. 

Approach: 
    1. Multi-Class Drawdown Classifier with Multi-Horizon Validation for Drawdown
    2. Model 2: Crash Prediction (Override)
With Multi-Class Drawdown  
    2 d matrix with drawdown and hulit-Horizon
    Initially do binary
    probalbity if binary does not work.
to calcluate:
    Phase 1: Use Your Current Empirical Weights
        You mentioned you already have weights based on crash prediction:

        HY Spread: 32%
        Yield Curve: 29%
        Market Breadth: ~15-20%
        CAPE: ~10-15%
        Spread Velocity: ~10-15%
    Phase 2: If You Need to Optimize
        Use weighted F1 grid search:    

Doing Simplest model to create prediction colums

Created combined simulated portfolio and now to do simualton of how to hedge.

looks like doing short term spyputs during the draw down...

Need to simulate option prices with SPX, VIX, and risk free rate.

Need to visualize predictions


Right now not predicting downturs or detectecing them. 
Need to fix them. 

predicting time horzion, drawdown and likelihood matrix
Alternatives
    1. Random Forrest vs elastic 
    2. universal weights vs time horizon base weights
    3. Muliple walk forwards in a future time. 
First pass elastic net with universal weights. 
Modify with time horizon or Random Forrest if approach does not work. 

need to contineu it
